# Week-4-Python-Assignment

1. File Read & Write Challenge 🖋️: Create a program that reads a file and writes a modified version to a new file.
2. Error Handling Lab 🧪: Ask the user for a filename and handle errors if it doesn’t exist or can’t be read.


## Instructions to Test:
1. For the File Read & Write Challenge:

     * Create a file named input.txt in the same directory.
     * Add some content to the file, e.g., "Hello, World!"
     * Run the script to generate output.txt with modified content (uppercase).

2. For the Error Handling Lab:

     * Provide a filename that exists to read its content.
     * Test error handling by entering non-existent or restricted filenames.

## Follow the prompts:
   * Enter the name of the file to read (e.g., input.txt).
   * Enter the name of the file to write (e.g., output.txt).
* Check the content of the output.txt file to verify it contains the modified content.
